Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions for Linux\* OS
================================================

# linux-sgx-driver

Introduction
------------
Intel(R) Software Guard Extensions (Intel(R) SGX) is an Intel technology for application developers seeking to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification.

The Linux SGX software stack is comprised of the Intel(R) SGX driver, the Intel(R) SGX SDK, and the Intel(R) SGX Platform Software. The Intel(R) SGX SDK and Intel(R) SGX PSW are hosted in the [linux-sgx](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx) project.

The [linux-sgx-driver](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx-driver) project hosts the out-of-tree driver for the Linux Intel(R) SGX software stack, which will be used until the driver upstreaming process is complete. 

Within the linux-sgx-driver project, two versions of the out-of-tree driver are provided. Both versions are compatible with the linux-sgx PSW and SDK:
- SGX 2.0 Linux Driver (sgx2)
  * The sgx2 branch of the linux-sgx-driver project contains the SGX 2.0 Linux Driver. This driver has additional support for SGX 2.0-based features available in upcoming CPUs. This driver has the same behavior as the SGX Linux Driver (master) on CPUs without SGX 2.0 support.
- SGX Linux Driver (master)
  * The master branch of the linux-sgx-driver project tracks the proposed upstream version of the SGX driver and does not yet support SGX 2.0-based features.

Contributing
-------
Starting from 05/2017, we are importing the sgx driver code from the in-kernel sgx repository located at git-hub: https://github.com/jsakkine-intel/linux-sgx.git. Any contribution should be done there. Future versions of the sgx driver code will be imported later on. The motivation behind this decision is to maintain a single source code of the sgx linux driver.
An additional directory inker2ext/ has been created, it contains a script and a patch file that can be used in order to separately generate the code base of the sgx external module; it can be used in case someone wants the newest sgx driver as an external module and does not want to wait for next update.

The sgx2 branch hosts an initial implementation supporting SGX 2.0. This patch is maintained in inker2ext/sgx2.patch in the 2.0 branch and will be periodically rebased to take updates from the linux-sgx-driver:master branch. Contributions for this patch should be managed directly through the linux-sgx-driver project on Github.

Build and Install the Intel(R) SGX Driver
-----------------------------------------

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have the following required operating systems:  
  * Ubuntu* Desktop-16.04-LTS 64bits
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.2 64bits
  * CentOS 7.3.1611 64bits
- Ensure that you have the following required hardware:  
  * 6th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) Processor (code named Skylake)
  * 7th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) Processor (code named Kaby Lake)
- Configure the system with the **SGX hardware enabled** option.

### Build the Intel(R) SGX Driver
**Note:** To use the SGX 2.0 driver, checkout or download the sgx2 branch and then follow the build instructions.

To build Intel(R) SGX driver, change the directory to the driver path and enter the following command:
```
$ make
```
You can find the driver *isgx.ko* generated in the same directory.

**Note:** In order to build the driver you need the kernel headers to be installed on your machine.
On CentOS operating system, you get those using: "sudo yum groupinstall  'Development Tools'".
Those header files are then located at: /usr/src/kernel/<kernel version> (the <kernel version> can be identified
using the command: 'uname -r'). For some reason and some CentOS versions, those headers are copied in a
different directory than /usr/src/kernel/`uname -r`. If this happens, then the driver build will fail.

A way to overcome this problem is to download those header files by searching on the web for:
"centos kernel header <your kernel version>". You should then find an rpm file from from https://centos.pkg.org.
Download and then open it at the right location: /usr/src/kernel/<kernel version>.
The 'make' command should then work properly.

### Install the Intel(R) SGX Driver
To install the Intel(R) SGX driver, enter the following command with root privilege:
```
$ sudo mkdir -p "/lib/modules/"`uname -r`"/kernel/drivers/intel/sgx"    
$ sudo cp isgx.ko "/lib/modules/"`uname -r`"/kernel/drivers/intel/sgx"    
$ sudo sh -c "cat /etc/modules | grep -Fxq isgx || echo isgx >> /etc/modules"    
$ sudo /sbin/depmod
$ sudo /sbin/modprobe isgx
```
On Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server or CentOS, need to run below command on each reboot
```
$ sudo /sbin/modprobe isgx
```    

### Uninstall the Intel(R) SGX Driver
Before uninstall the Intel(R) SGX driver, make sure the aesmd service is stopped. See the topic, Start or Stop aesmd Service, on how to stop the aesmd service.  
To uninstall the Intel(R) SGX driver, enter the following commands: 
```
$ sudo /sbin/modprobe -r isgx
$ sudo rm -rf "/lib/modules/"`uname -r`"/kernel/drivers/intel/sgx"
$ sudo /sbin/depmod
$ sudo /bin/sed -i '/^isgx$/d' /etc/modules
```
